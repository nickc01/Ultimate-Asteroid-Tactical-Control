# Ultimate Asteroid Tactical Control

Ultimate Asteroid Tactical Control (UAT), is a simple asteroid game where you pilot a space ship and shoot down asteroids. It was one of the first projects I have done for a game programming class at college, and was mean't to show the basics of using Unity, such as Sprites, Rigidbodies and Instantiation. It also shows off a parallax effect on the background, where multiple different background elements move at different rates to give the illusion of depth
